Guessing game for Study.com's Guessing Game Assignment

1. Create a Python project in IDLE and begin the Project Program by developing a Python Function called `display_title()` to display the title and programming specifications for the project.
2. Expand the Project Program and create a function called `play_game()` that uses the `randint()` function that gets the number that the player has to guess. It then returns a random number between **1 and 10**. Use a `while` statement so the user can guess the number until the guess is correct. If the users guess is lower than the random number then display the message ***'Too low'***. If the user guess is higher than the random number then display the message ***'Too high'***. If the user guess matches the random number display the message, ***'You guessed it'***. Then, a `return` statement returns to the statement in the `main()` function that is after the call to the `play_game()` function.
3. Expand the Project Program and create `main()` function to the function call statements. From the main function, call the `display_title()` function. Then define a variable that will hold the value of yes. Create a loop that will check the variable, `while` the variable equals yes then call the `play_game` function. Then allow the user to input if they want to play again. If ***yes***, play again, if ***no*** end the program.
4. Execute the `main()` function
